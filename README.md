# E^2: emotional-enlightenment
(CodeDay 2019 Hackathon Project, Contributors: Karen Li, Stephanie Guan)

E^2 is a chrome extension that uses natural language processing to determine a body of text's or article's emotional stance. The level of optimism or pessimism is displayed as a sentiment analysis score from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a very negative standpoint and 1 indicates a very positive standpoint. This can be a useful tool for those who want a quick overview of an article before reading, or for non-native English speakers who struggle with understanding especially dense articles.
